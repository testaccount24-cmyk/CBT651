Sam,

The IBM list asked last week if someone had a routine to update
BWO flags in batch.  We had something in CICS which I've
converted to batch.  I'd like to share it with the world if it is
wanted.  Please take a look at the code and see if it would be
worthy of a CBTTAPE contribution.

.asm is the source + macros, and .txt is a sample output.

Sincerely,
Chip Grantham


See attached file: GDEBWOBT for the code.
See attached file: $OUTPUT  for sample output, in XMIT-format so
                            it could fit into an FB-80 pds.  When
                            this member is RECEIVEd, it will be an
                            FBA-133 file suitable for printing.
